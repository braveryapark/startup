#First edit from vscode

#First edit from github

#Conflict from VS

#I learned that vs code is pretty nifty. I'd always made things harder going through the command line over and over, but it was all right here!
#I also learned that it is still a learning curve. I struggled with resolving the conflict and ended up doing an empty commit to github wich somehow fixed it. Idk, but it worked. 
#Overall, happy to know about this!
